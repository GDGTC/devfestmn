# DEVFEST MN 2015 Website

# Getting Started

This project is built through Gulp, with packages managed by NPM and Bower, so
a few quick commands are necessary to get set up.

### Building

  - ```sudo npm install```  
  - ```bower install```
  - ```gulp```
  
### Running

  Build steps are managed by a set of tasks in gulpfile.js.
  
  To serve files from /dist, run:
  - ```gulp serve```
  
  This will simultaneously serve files from dist/, and start live-reload on the app/
  directory to begin watching for changes there and rebuilding/reloading dist/ as they occur
  
### Creating custom elements

  This project was scaffolded with the [Official Gulp-Polymer Yeoman Generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-polymer)
  Full instructions for installing the necessary Yeoman dependencies and using the generator's commands to 
  build out new elements of the project are helpfully listed there.
