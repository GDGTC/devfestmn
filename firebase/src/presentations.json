Come and learn how containers are helping us to move toward a future of widespread Platform-as-a-Service. This presentation will address the following questions:  - What are containers? - Why is this so important to Google’s Cloud Platform strategy? - Why didn’t this happen earlier? - How will containers change the way I develop and deploy applications? - I develop on AppEngine: Aren’t I already developing in containers?",
